# Neural Network Analysis Report

## Summary
In this analysis, we evaluated the performance of a neural network with various combinations of hyperparameters. The dataset used was the Spambase dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Results
- **Activation Functions**: The 'relu' activation function generally performed the best, achieving higher test accuracies compared to 'logistic' and 'tanh'.
- **Learning Rates**: A learning rate of 0.01 tended to yield better results than 0.001.
- **Epochs**: Increasing the number of epochs improved the model's performance, but beyond a certain point, the improvement was marginal.
- **Hidden Layers and Neurons**: More hidden layers and neurons generally improved performance, but with diminishing returns.

## Best Configuration
The best configuration was found to be:
- Activation: 'relu'
- Learning Rate: 0.01
- Epochs: 2000
- Hidden Layers: 2
- Neurons per Layer: 20

## Assumptions
- The dataset was preprocessed to handle missing values and standardize features.
- Early stopping was used to prevent overfitting.
